# SNF
Smith Normal Form (SNF) calculator for integers and gaussian integers

This function is a proof of concept SNF calculator. This codebase was developed for an 
Algebra II course at Wheaton College, IL. Currently, the only way to run the code is to 
run `python snf.py` and step through the interactive input method. Semi-verbose output
will be printed to stdout showing the steps of the calculation followed by a presention
of the final results. 

The SNF calculator can calculate the SNF of matrices over either the integers or the 
gaussian integers, however it could be easily extended to work with matrices over any
euclidian domain, by simply writing another class of the same form as the integers and 
gaussian integers classes.
